This information is used for reliability, debugging, security, and product improvement.")

In the current mobile app, messaging private keys and a separate local messaging-storage key are kept in device secure storage, and decrypted local message history and cached private messaging attachments are re-encrypted at rest on device.")
                Text("Private messages are temporarily queued on Split’s servers only as needed for delivery. In the current service, private message records awaiting recipient acknowledgement are generally retained for up to 24 hours if the recipient is offline and are deleted from the server when acknowledged or when they expire. Private messaging attachment blobs are stored separately as encrypted blobs and are deleted after confirmed recipient receipt or expiration, subject to limited operational delays.")

                Text("When available, Split may distribute bitcoin rewards to eligible users based on spending with participating merchants during a given period (for example, a calendar month). Split attributes eligible spend by comparing the receiving identifier of a payment (such as a merchant public key) against Split’s database of participating merchant identifiers.")
                Text("Rewards are discretionary and may be funded by Split and/or sponsors. Rewards are not guaranteed, may change over time, and may be paused or discontinued. Split does not require item-level purchase information to calculate rewards, and we do not control merchants’ goods, services, pricing, or fulfillment.")

                Text("Split may use limited usage and transaction metadata for internal analytics, product improvement, and fraud prevention. Split may also use website analytics tools or similar technologies to understand website traffic and usage patterns. We do not use your transaction metadata for third-party targeted advertising. If our data practices change in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and provide notice as required by law.")

You acknowledge that use of the Service is at your own risk. Split cannot recover lost wallet keys or reverse Lightning payments, and we cannot guarantee that security measures will never be bypassed.")

                Text("Different data types may have different retention periods. For example, private messages awaiting delivery are generally retained only temporarily, while public Proof of Spend posts may remain available until you delete them, Split removes them, or they are otherwise removed from the Service.")

                    .font(.headline)
                Text("You may stop using the Service at any time. You may choose whether to upload a profile photo, use private messaging, or publish a Proof of Spend post. Because Proof of Spend posts are public, you should carefully consider what you choose to publish.")
                Text("You may delete your own Proof of Spend posts through the Service. Because Split does not collect traditional personal identity information for typical use, there may be limited ability to access, modify, or delete all data associated with your use of the Service, especially where retention is necessary for security, fraud prevention, legal compliance, or rewards administration.")
